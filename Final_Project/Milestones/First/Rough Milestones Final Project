In this document we will present the rough milestones weekly for the completion of the final project

Week 4 - 28/10

The adquisition, webscrapping and downloading of the databases should be completed (Scripts will be kept running).
We have began to understand and filter the data

Week 5 - 04/11

We should already have all the data downloaded and ready to work. In this week we will do the cleaning, normalization and
start joining all the data by the zone. Mockup of the Dashboard. All proper data architectures should be already done

Week 6 - 11/11

We would do all the exploratory data analysis of the joined dataframe(s), to find proper correlations, filter some features
and begin to decide the appropiate models to use. 

Week 7 - 18/11

We should run the model and do the proper iterations of it, adjusting the hyperparameters. At this instance we should have already
all the results to make the visualizations

Week 8 - 25/11

We will begin to build the dashboards with visualizations by different timeframes. Interactivity will be a key point of all of them

Week 9 - 02/12

We expect to get some peer review from other groups. Also the strategy for the final 
presentation would be defined.  This is the week of the final presentation, so the last milestone will be to pack our bags for Cartagena!
